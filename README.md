# Project2Tuong

## Project 2 - Shiny (Mobile Device Usage).

This project contains two important files: Project2Tuong.qmd and app.R in Project2TuongShiny, and was created using RStudio.

### Preparing the Data and Exploratory Analysis - .qmd

-   The .qmd file contains the data set to prepare for the mobile device application and general exploratory analysis of the mobile device usage data set; here you will find contingency tables, numerical summaries, and different plots analyzing different variables regarding mobile device usage that I have found interesting and explored.
-   Feel free to check it out on GitHub! Link: https://statstuff274.github.io/Project2Tuong/Project2Tuong.html

### Mobile Device Analysis Application - R Shiny

The app.R is a mobile device analyzation application allowing users to subset the data set by categorical and numeric variables according to render, view, and download filtered data sets as well as provides numerical and graphical visualizations to explore the filtered data.

\- Application Instructions:

> 1\.
> Choose a specific level from each of the three categorical variables (model device, operating system, and gender) - if nothing is chosen, All levels for each variable will be applied.

> 2\.
> Choose a range of values from the two numerical values to subset (there are three numerical variables you may choose from: battery drain, data usage, and screen time)

> 3\.
> Click Update Analysis to subset the data accordingly then sift through the Data Download and Data Exploration tab to view your filtered data.

> 4\.
> The Data Download tab will allow you to view your filtered results and download that as a .csv file.

> 5\.
> The Data Exploration tab will allow you to observe numerical and graphical summaries based on your filtered data.
