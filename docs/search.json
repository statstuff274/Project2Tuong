So when looking at this plot below, roughly 150 daily Android users and about 30-35 iOS users will drain their phone battery by 240 to 750 mAh everyday. As for those who drain their battery by an average of 3000 mAh (between 2750 and 3250) every day, that number is much less at about 47 Android users and about 17 iOS users. When comparing the frequencies across both operating systems, both OS's seem to have a very similar visual pattern of battery drain proportionally based on mAh from 750 mAh to 2750 mAh.\n\n\n# Plot 5: Created a density plot (smoothed histogram) to observe screen time per day based on gender.\n\ndensity_plot5 &lt;- ggplot(mobdevdata |&gt;\n                    drop_na(Screen.On.Time..hours.day.), aes(x = Screen.On.Time..hours.day., fill = Gender)) + \n                  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n                  ggtitle(label = \"Screen Time by Gender\",\n                    subtitle = \"Density Plot (Smoothed Histogram)\") +\n                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n                    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n                  labs(x = \"Screen Time (hours per day)\",\n                    y = \"Density\") +\n                  scale_fill_discrete(\"Gender\")                \ndensity_plot5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Below is a density plot, a smooth curve that shows the distribution of the data. Similar to histograms except with an added curve on top, the curve represents the proportion of the data in the ranges rather than the frequency/counts like a histogram would. The x-axis showcases screen time per day and the y-axis represents the density, meaning the probability/how probable the different intervals for screen time are for each gender. Looking at this plot, we can see that males have higher screen times overall; however, females do seem to have a peak average of more screen time when hitting 3 hour and 25 minute mark to about the 7 hour and 25 minute mark. Interesting - I wonder why that might be the case.\n\n\n# Plot 6: Created a scatter plot to observe correlations between screen time and data usage by operating system.\n\nscatter_plot6 &lt;- ggplot(mobdevdata,\n                    aes(x = Screen.On.Time..hours.day., y = Data.Usage..MB.day., color = Operating.System)) +\n                  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) +\n                  ggtitle(label = \"Screen Time and Data Usage \\n by Operating System\",\n                          subtitle = \"Scatter Plot\") +\n                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n                        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n                  labs(x = \"Screen Time (hours per day)\", \n                       y = \"Data Usage \\n (megabytes per day)\") +\n                  scale_fill_discrete(\"Operating System\")\nscatter_plot6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Below is a scatter plot between screen time and data usage by operating system; this is used in order to observe and determine if there may be a relationship between these variables. The plot shows a positive, strong correlation between screen time and data usage for both Android and iOS. As screen time increases, data usage also increases.\n\n\n# Plot 7: Used previous scatter plot while faceting with gender.\n\nfacet_plot7 &lt;- ggplot(mobdevdata, \n                    aes(x = Screen.On.Time..hours.day., y = Data.Usage..MB.day., color = Operating.System)) +\n                  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.35) +\n                  ggtitle(label = \"Screen Time and Data Usage \\n by Operating System with Gender Facet\",\n                          subtitle = \"Scatter Plot with Facet\") +\n                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n                        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n                  labs(x = \"Screen Time (hours per day)\", \n                       y = \"Data Usage \\n (megabytes per day)\") +\n                  facet_grid(Gender ~ Operating.System) \nfacet_plot7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Below, is the previous plot except faceted with gender. First we check and take the correlation between screen time and data usage based on operating system and now we've further subset the data to take gender into account as well. From here we can see that there is a strong, positive correlation between screen time and data usage, even when taking operating system and gender into account. As mentioned before, the main difference is that there are more Android users than iOS users, otherwise they are similar in many aspects - strong, positive correlation with majority of the data points for both operating systems falling between 1 to 2.5 hours of screen time per day.\n\n\n# Plot 8: Created a ridgeline plot to visualize changes in distributions of data usage and operating system.\n\nquantile_plot8 &lt;- ggplot(mobdevdata,\n                         aes(x = Data.Usage..MB.day., y = Operating.System, fill = factor(stat(quantile)))) + \n                  stat_density_ridges(\n                          geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", calc_ecdf = TRUE,\n                          quantiles = 4, quantile_lines =) +\n                  ggtitle(label = \"Changes of Data Usage and Operating System\",\n                          subtitle = \"Ridgeline Plot\") +\n                  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n                        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n                  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\")\nquantile_plot8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Using stat_density_ridges from the ggridges package, I've created a plot that visualizes data usage based on amount of mobile devices per operating system. For example, the peak for both mountain ranges on data usage is around 380 to 430 megabytes used per day. After that peak, the amount of users for both operating systems decrease after that. Additionally, this ridgeline plot produces three lines, indicating the quartiles. In this case we have 3 quartiles: 1st, 2nd (the median), and the 3rd. Ridgeplot are a nice way to visualize changes in distribution over time or space.\n\n\n# Plot 9: Created a bubble plot to look at battery drain, data usage, and number of apps installed across user behavior class.\n\nbubble_plot9 &lt;- ggplot(mobdevdata,\n                    aes(x = Battery.Drain..mAh.day., y = Data.Usage..MB.day., \n                    size = Number.of.Apps.Installed, color = User.Behavior.Class)) +\n                geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +\n                ggtitle(label = \"Relationship between Battery Drain, Data Usage, and \\n Number of Apps Installed across User Behavior Class\",\n                        subtitle = \"Bubble Plot\") +\n                theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n                      plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n                  labs(x = \"Battery Drain (mAh per day)\", \n                       y = \"Data Usage \\n (megabytes per day)\")\nbubble_plot9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A bubble plot, an extension of the scatter plot, is used to look at relationships between three numeric variables, minimally. It in the variables, x, y, and size, battery drain, data usage, and number of apps installed, respectively. Here, the relationship between battery drain (x) and data usage (y) of number of apps installed is represented. I've also added a fourth variable, user behavior class, which is denoted by the color. \n\n\nMobile device usage is an interesting topic to say the least. Due to the universal and widespread usage of mobile devices, there will always be research conducted to see how our lives are affected by these devices, especially regarding things like how much time we spend on these devices, how battery drain varies based on operating system, if data usage differs based on gender, etc… and from there we may further research on how these different variables may affect our mental/physical health and whatnot. While technology and mobile devices will continue to be an intergral part of our lives, it’s important that we do our due diligence and be mindful about our own mobile device usage to ensure it doesn’t negatively impact our lives.\n\n\n# General Notes:\n# Addition packages to download/to do from notes:\n# install.packages(\"shinydashboard\") - tabItems() - spinners, tabPanel() (37 Debug)\n# install.packages(shinyalert\") - verify values\n\n# Use observeEvent() to look for changes in tab id (Flexible UI Layouts)\n# r4ds examples\n\n# Notes - variables used:\n# quantitative variables (screen on time, battery drain, data usage)\n# categorical variables (operating system, gender, and user behavior class)"
